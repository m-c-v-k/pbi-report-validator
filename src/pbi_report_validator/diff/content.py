"""Diff what matched visuals show and how the report is filtered.

Covers fields per visual, filters at report, page and visual level and
slicer selections. Field keys and conditions on the old side are first
rewritten through the measure rename map, so a renamed measure is not
reported again for every visual or filter that uses it. The new side is
never rewritten: a new visual that still uses a measure's old name is a
broken reference and is reported.
